## Attributes

There are two types of attributes: **independent** and **dependent** variables.

**Dependent** variable attributes will be mapped, by thresholds, to a 4-point scale, calculated by a set equation. Dependent variables may use other constant values and independent variables to determine its rating. Attributes must be specifically set to be a dependent variable to be visualized in the radar chart.

**Independent** variable attributes are values that dependent variables require to be calculated. They are not measured and mapped to the radar chart. An example of an independent variable is the vehicle's _maximum capacity_. Some dependent variables, such as the vehicle's _total space occupied_ will be calculated on a per-passenger basis. While _space occupied_ will be visualized, _maximum capacity_ was factored into the calculation and will not be visualized.

### Predefined unit types

These allow for unit conversion.

- **Scalar**: This is a value without a unit. (For instance: number of passengers)
- **Weight**
- **Speed**
- **Area**
